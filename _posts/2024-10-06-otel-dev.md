## Getting Started

```
.PHONY: otel
otel:
	open http://localhost:16686
	docker run --rm --name jaeger \
	  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
	  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
	  -p 5775:5775/udp \
	  -p 6831:6831/udp \
	  -p 6832:6832/udp \
	  -p 5778:5778 \
	  -p 16686:16686 \
	  -p 14250:14250 \
	  -p 14268:14268 \
	  -p 14269:14269 \

```

Aims
Simplify the opentelemetry + monitoring integration across services

Getting started
There's an example for how to instrument in main.go
You can run a local jaeger server by using make otel which will start the UI on http://localhost:16686/search, by default the make command wil launch the default browser and open the page for you
You can run the example service using make example, this will begin to emit traces to your local instance of jaeger

Running in production
You will need to provide the configuration that points to the OpenTelemetry OTLP port
Endpoint:

ConfOpenTelemetry.Endpoint should correspond to the Opentelemetry OTLP port available
In a GCP Kubernetes environment this is the address of the grafana-agent installed

ServiceName:

This is the unique identifier for your service

SampleRatio:

This is a decimal percentage representation of how many traces you want to send, in a high volume environment, you generally don't need to send all traces to get representative trace output
This is important given volume considerations and billing in grafana cloud in particular


{
  "Endpoint":"grafana-agent-flow.grafana:4317",
  "ServiceName":"my-service",
  "SampleRatio": 1
}
