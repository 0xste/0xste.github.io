After an even longer period of procrastination I've finally got back into writing, times have changed quite a bit since the last time i wrote on a technical topic, the advent of LLMs has both drastically improved and worsened the state of tech blogs in my view. Using this microsite to throw my hat in the ring and hope that there's only a minimal level of hallucination, overfitting and lack of novelty in the content.

I now lead the Platform Engineering team at Blockdaemon, where our focus is largely on Developer Experience across both "Web2" and "Web3"; in simpler terms, we're largely working on:

- Scaling our http routing infrastructure globally to better serve customers
- Maturing our blockchain provisioning platform to handle more complex scenarios, and reduce operational burden
- The usual Developer Experience improvements around pipeline standardization, shared packages and libraries

A note to the reader: I promise to use AI language models only for formatting markdown documents and generating silly images
